    - title: Machine Learning Engineer Intern
      institution: Transatlantic Reinsurance Pvt. Ltd.
      year: 2023
      description:
          - Spearheaded the development of a sophisticated in-house Large Language Model QA bot, assisting the risk assessment process for underwriters.
          - Conducted extensive testing and evaluation of multiple open-source models, including Falcon 7B Instruct, MPT 7B, RedPajamas, and Llama 2, to determine the most suitable model for the project's requirements.
          - Successfully deployed the final application using Llama 2 via HuggingFace, optimizing its performance and usability.
          - Leveraged Langchain to augment risk-assessment related data-pipelines with specialized chains for Summarization, Conversational Retrieval, and Multiple Document retrieval, resulting in reduced inference time.
          - Pioneered the implementation of a feedback-mechanism to enforce PEFT, facilitating the fine-tuning of the Llama 2 model to continuously improve the bot's performance and accuracy.
