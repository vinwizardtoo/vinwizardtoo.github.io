Hello! I'm Vinay, a diligent and aspiring AI Engineer, ready to delve into the world of cutting edge AI research and it's corresponding engineering. Currently a final year grad student at <a href='cmu.edu'>Carnegie Mellon University</a>, graduating soon with a <a href='https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/'>Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation</a> and having had diverse experiences focusing on <b>Large Language Models</b>, <b>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</b>, <b>Multimodal Grounding</b>, <b>Multihop Multimodal Question Answering</b> and many others; I aim to solve complex real world problems through pioneering advances in AI and its related technologies.

During my educational pursuits at CMU, Iâ€™ve honed skills in sophisticated Neural Network Architectures, Alignment for Multimodal LLMs, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing. I had the fortune of being a Research Assistant under <a href = "https://yuchengliang.com/">Dr. Yucheng Liang</a> at CMU, where I developed and deployed an advanced Retrieval QA chatbot using GPT-4 and Whisper, enhancing real-time information access for survey respondents and streamlining data interaction across multiple formats. I also have experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, where I've strengthened my abilities in both conveying complex concepts and steering team dynamics for group projects, equipping me to communicate professionally with my peers. 

I thrive in innovative and collaborative environments; enriching the team's experience through my innovative and out of the box thinking idealogy. I continuously read up on new technologies that are backed up by credible publications to constantly augment myself.
