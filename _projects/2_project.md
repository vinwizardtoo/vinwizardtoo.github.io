In this project, a retrieval pipeline for Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) Retrieval, where was experimented with, where the usage of LLMs as query decomposers and re-rankers was studied. This system surpassed the GPT-4 baselines provided by the TREC-ToT 1 organizers leveraging the two techniques above, while considering smaller models.
