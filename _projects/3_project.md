In this project, a language learning conversational agent was created using advanced Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning techniques to tailor dialogues that introduce new linguistic concepts based on the learner's current proficiency. The agent's proficiency assessment utilizes a transformer-based NLP model to analyze the learner's input and a Reinforcement Learning framework to optimize the introduction of new language elements. An extensive language learning ontology was developed to inform the agent's content strategy, ensuring contextually relevant and pedagogically structured interactions. The agent's dialogue generation is designed to incrementally challenge the learner, facilitating optimal retention and mastery of the new language.
